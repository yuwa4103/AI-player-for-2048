# AI-player-for-2048
2048 is a game which is played on a 4X4 board, and each tile has an even number, player just can move to 4 directions (right, left, up, down). If two tiles have the same number, then these two tiles combine to single new tile with their summation. Until stopped by another tile or hit the board, all tiles can move on any directions. A new tile with number 2 or 4 when appears randomly on an empty tile, the can be moved or  combined with another exit tile again. However, when a new tile moves, it cannot merge with its neighbor tile. No tile can be move or no empty cell, game ends. If number 2048 shows on the board, the player wins and game ends. There is a scoreboard to track the score of players. Once merged, the score will appear the combination of two tiles value. The scoreboard will keep the highest score along with the current score.
